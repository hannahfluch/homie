[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/homie)](https://crates.io/crates/homie)

## Description
**Homie** is here to keep you company while you work on your computer! It‚Äôs an animated, interactive little friend that runs across your screen and responds to your clicks.

## Prerequisites 
- **Rust**: Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, head over to [Rust‚Äôs official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions.
- **GTK4-layer-shell**: Homie uses GTK4 for rendering the character as an overlay window. Thus, it is only available on Wayland. 

## Installation 

Homie is available on the [**AUR**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/homie-bin). Alternatively, it can be installed from Crates.io:
```bash
cargo install homie
```

### Build locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hannahfluch/homie.git
cd homie
```

2. Build the project using cargo
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## How to Run üèÉ

Run this command to use homie with the rat sprites, a width of 200 pixels, 9fps and a movement speed of 35:
```bash
homie -s ./res/rat_sprites/ -w 200 -f 9 -m 35
```

Homie is also able to infer the width/height according to the aspect ratio of the original picture, if only one dimension is provided.
> Note: This can lead to unwanted behavior when switching sprites on-the-fly.

For more information run this command:
```bash
homie -h
```

For example, a red dino can be rendered using [this](docs/examples/dino.toml) config.

## Reloading Sprites On-the-Fly
Want to update Homie's appearance without restarting the program? Homie can receive signals to reload the sprites:

```bash
kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>
```
> Send SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2

Replace <pid> with the process ID of the Homie instance. This will trigger Homie to reload the sprite animations dynamically

Instead, the `automatic-reload` flag in combination with the `signal-frequency` configuration can be used.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
Homie creates a default configuration file upon its first run. This file is located at:

```bash
~/.config/homie/config.toml
```

### Default Configuration File
The configuration file includes all necessary settings to customize your Homie's behavior and appearance. However, for Homie to function, **you must specify a valid sprite path**:
1. Using **command-line arguments**
2. Adding the sprite path to the **configuration file**

## Custom Sprites üé®
Homie thrives on customization! Just provide a directory containing 3 different gifs(`idle`, `click`, `run`), and watch your Homie come to life with your own animations.
